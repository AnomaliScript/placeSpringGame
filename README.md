Hello! This is a mini-metroidverse game created by me over the summer (and into the school year)
This game is SIDE-SCROLLING, which I think is is pretty cool!

## Basic controls
w: jump
a: move left
s: jump upside-down (when upside-down, ofc)
d: move right

i: switchGravity
l: debugMode (a bunch of text that may make no sense; it's for me to help me debug the code)

## WARNING: This game might crash because the last time I tried to pull up the editor to work on my game more, I got the "aw, snap" webpage error ðŸ˜¬
