# placeSprigGame
Hello! This is a mini-metroidverse game created by me over the summer (and into the school year)

## Description
I wanted to make this game replicate a metroidverse game as much as possible, so I made the same scrolling (both vertically and horizontally!)
The vertical scrolling was much harder mainly because of the gravity gimmicks and blocks that would be at the "start of a level", meaning that there would be a block on x=0 on the level that is right of the level that the player is currently in, making it hard to see for the game to see that the block is there because sprig is built in a way where maps are the only thing that toolkit functions can scan and blah blah blah........... :exhausted:
All in all, this was, and will continue to be (this is a WIP) an interesting but also a very rewarding project; that's because I love metroidvanias!
If you don't know what metroidvanias are, look them up.
Notable metroidvanias include (but not limited to): Hollow Knight, Ori BF and Ori WotW, Rain World

A lot of comments are still in the code, that's how you know I've been debugging a whole ton ðŸ˜…
(NOTE TO HACK CLUB: PLEASE MAKE A DEBUG MODE IN SPRIG LIKE THEY HAVE IN VS CODE PLEASEEE)

Video of me playtesting the game (still got a ways to go): https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4003aaf2-8745-47d9-ac26-ab3586f79484

## Basic controls
w: jump
a: move left
s: jump upside-down (when upside-down, ofc)
d: move right

i: switchGravity (upside-down to right-side up or vice versa)
j: break surrounding glass (orthogonally like a king in chess)
k: enter doors (most recent update)
l: debugMode (a bunch of text that may make no sense; it's for me to help me debug the code)
